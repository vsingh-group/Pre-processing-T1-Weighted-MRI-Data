# Cortical Thickness Graph Creation for GCNs

- The first step is to Resample <freesurfer_output_subject>/surf/lh.thickness onto fsaverage. Official doc [here](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/mris_preproc)
  - Setup Freesurfer environments and update the SUBJECTS_DIR that contains processed subject directories.
  - In the ``SUBJECTS_DIR`` copy the fsaverage directory located in Freesurfer folder ```/freesurfer/subjects/fsaverage```.
  - ```mris_preproc --s $f \ --target fsaverage --hemi rh --meas thickness --out rh.thickness.mgh``` This maps the right hemisphere cortical thickness of subject $f onto fsaverage subject's rh and save in rh.thickness.mgh. Run ```mris_preproc.sh``` script in subject directory to process all the subjects.

Now each of the subject has been resampled to fsaverage brain with 163842 vertices. To read the ```rh.thickness.mgh``` an example is shown in ```read_mgh.py``` file. The output of this will return a list of lists where the first index is the cortical thickness of the vertex 1 and so on. Therefore the size of the retured list is 163842 X 1

Now you can create an adjacency matrix using the rh.pial surface from fsaverage, since all the subjects are mapped to it. The returned matrix will be of size 163842 X 163842. You can use Won Hwa Kim's [CTA_toolbox](http://ranger.uta.edu/~wonhwa/cta_toolbox.html) to read the sruface and create the adjacency matrix. Once you have the tool box downloaded and added to the path you can run ```[vertices, faces] = read_surf("rh.pial")``` to get the vertices and faces, from which you can create Graph laplacial adjacency matrix. You can now use the cortical thickness files of shape 163842 X n, where n is number of subjects, and 163842 X 163842 adjacency matrix to run a GCN algorithm. An example of spectral GCN on cortical thickness and creation of sample data is given [here](https://github.com/bieqa/LB-CNN)
